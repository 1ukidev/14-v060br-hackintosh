# Hackintosh in HP Pavilion 14-v060br
This repository has EFI OpenCore 0.6.5 properly configured for HP Pavilion 14-v060br.

Everything seems to be working correctly on macOS Catalina and Big Sur.

If you find a problem, create an [issue](https://github.com/1ukidev/14-v060br-hackintosh/issues/new).

## Softwares to have after installation:
[HeliPort](https://github.com/OpenIntelWireless/HeliPort) - Required to be able to use Wi-Fi.

[Android File Transfer](https://www.android.com/filetransfer) - Required to transfer files between macOS and an Android device (already saved me once)
